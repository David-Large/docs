[CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com) is a Git-based content management system that provides a visual editor for your content.

## Introduction

This guide will walk through the steps required to get your Astro site built, editable and live on CloudCannon. CloudCannon makes it easy to store your content in your Git repository and have non-developers update it with a live visual editing interface.

## Prerequisites

To get started you will need to have the following:

1. **An Astro project** - If you don’t have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](/en/install/auto/) will get you up and running in no time.

## Sync your files

The first step for connecting any site is to get your file system linked to CloudCannon. CloudCannon will need to clone your files to disk before anything else — this is the same process as if you were working locally in your development environment.

CloudCannon offers multiple ways of connecting your files:

- Git syncing through [GitHub](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/), [Bitbucket](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/), [GitLab](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/) and [self-hosted GitLab](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/).
- [Uploading a folder or zip of your files](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/).

It is highly recommended that you use the Git syncing option. This allows your updates on CloudCannon to push back to your repository. Your editors can then contribute to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This step is configured through an OAuth connection with the relevant partner. 

Check out CloudCannon’s [connecting your first site](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-your-first-site/) guide for more information on this step.

## Build your site

The second step for any new site is to get a successful build. This also mirrors your local development environment. On CloudCannon, select Astro as your SSG.

The important things to configure here are:

- Any required environment variables
- Install Command: Command to install dependencies before build. By default this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
- Build Command: Command to build your site. By default this runs `npm run build`. This is similar to the install command. An example of this build is `astro build`.
- Output Path: Path to the output folder you are building into. This is important because CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site. By default Astro builds into the `dist` folder.

You may find you need extra commands to complete your build. A common example is using postcss; for this you can use build hooks, adding specially named bash scripts that run at different steps in the build. For more information, see [CloudCannon’s build hook documentation](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/).

### Preview URL

Once your site is built, you will see a big green tick on the screen. At this point, your site’s files are synced and a successful build has been run. This means you have unlocked a newly generated preview URL.

In the top left corner of the screen under your site name, there is a blue link, styled *adjective-noun.cloudvent.net*. Clicking this link will open a new tab to the hosted site on CloudCannon. 

It is a helpful step at this point to check that the site looks correct. If it does, you can move on to editor configuration. If you need to update your build, this can be done in your settings.

Your new *adjective-noun.cloudvent.net* site will give you a preview after every change. Use this to show off your new site.

## Configuring

Astro has relatively strong opinions about how to organize the content in your site. This means that CloudCannon's editing concepts integrate naturally with Astro. CloudCannon organizes data using two main concepts:

- *Data*: These are standalone data files. This is ideal for site configuration or files that don’t need to repeat. Data is edited by altering to a single file.
- *Collections*: A folder of files that represent a repeatable data format. This is a good fit for pages, blogs, staff members, recipes, etc. Collections are edited by altering any file or adding more files.

In Astro terms, CloudCannon Collections correspond to Astro [Content Collections](/en/guides/content-collections/). Data files, on the other hand, correspond to standalone JSON files that are imported with Javascript. CloudCannon supports a set of file formats for files in Data or Collections:

- Structured data files: JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, TSV.
- Markup files: HTML, Markdown.
- Combination files: HTML with front matter, Markdown with front matter.

### Tell CloudCannon about your data

Now that your site is successfully built, you need to tell CloudCannon how to interpret your collections and data. For this we use the [CloudCannon reader](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader), an open-source NPM library used to integrate editing.

Check out [CloudCannon's documentation](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader) and define your collections. Once you have pushed your changes to CloudCannon, a new build will make new interfaces available. You will be able to:

- Add, remove, edit and rename any collection item.
- Edit any data file.

You will have numerous editing options available to you:

- Source Editor: edit your code directly within CloudCannon in a familiar-looking editor.
- Data Editor: Edit your data and front matter in a recursive form full of customizable inputs.
    - Add, remove, clone, rearrange and edit arrays.
    - Open objects and edit content to any depth.
    - Change data with date, color, number, URL, and more inputs.
- Content Editor: Edit your markdown files and data at the same time. A big content block for your markdown and an embedded data editor on the side. This is perfect for a combination of markdown and front matter files.
- Visual Editor: A combination editor with your live site on one side and the data editor on the other side. The rest of this tutorial will focus on integrating the two sides more.

## Configuring CloudCannon

With your collections configured in CloudCannon, you can focus on polishing the experience for your editors. A good place to start is expanding on your collection configuration. This allows you to do things like:

- Change the icons, names, descriptions, and documentation links in the collections interface.
- Define which editors can be used to edit each collection item.
- Manage the order of collections in the sidebar and how they are grouped (e.g. Blogging > Posts).
- Show and hide collections entirely.

The global configuration file is one of many places that configuration can exist. Some options can exist only in the global config. Others options can be configured in a number of places; these options always start with an `_` character. These options cascade like CSS: the more specific the options are, the more they take precedence. From most to least important, the order is:

1. Containing structure.
2. Front matter.
3. Collection configuration.
4. Global configuration.

### Configuring inputs

A common option to be configured in the cascade is `_inputs`. This option allows you to change what input is used for which keys. This can be anything from a text input, color pickers, select fields, date pickers and more. By default, CloudCannon uses the format of your data and keys to decide on the input to use. It is best to review each collection and adjust these as needed.

Another great cascade option is `_structures` which allows you to control how new array and object items are added. Arrays are a great way to create page builders or a configurable navigation.

## Implement visual editing

Visual editing on CloudCannon, using the open-source tool [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop), can be broken down into two separate parts:

1. [Previews](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/using-live-editing-with-vanilla-js/): When data is changed in a data editor, the new changes are visible immediately on the page. You can achieve this by using Astro's client-side hydration to include JavaScript on your site that listens for changes in CloudCannon and updates your content automatically.
2. [Bindings](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/): Tagging elements on the page tells CloudCannon where the data came from. CloudCannon can then attach a UI to those parts directly on the page. This frees the editor from using the Data Editor in the sidebar.

The final result is something intuitive and easy to teach.

For more information on how to set up live visual editing, there is a full guide to [Astro & Bookshop](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/bookshop-astro-guide/), CloudCannon’s open-source component development workflow, available on CloudCannon’s website.

## Rejoice & Share

That’s it for the base Astro setup. Your Data Editor will still be using the automatic configuration. If you find that some inputs could be improved, be sure to check out [how to configure inputs](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/).

Now that you are happy with the experience as a developer, you can share it with your team or clients. If you have an internal team, see [team sharing](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/). If you have a client, see [client sharing](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/giving-clients-access-to-update-a-site/).
